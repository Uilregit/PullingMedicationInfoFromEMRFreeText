361,361,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 61-year-old woman with a history of polyarteritis nodosa, mononeuritis multiplex involving the lower extremities, and severe sleep apnea returns in followup following an overnight sleep study, on CPAP and oxygen to evaluate her for difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep.  She returns today to review results of an inpatient study performed approximately two weeks ago.,In the meantime, the patient reports she continues on substantial doses of opiate medication to control leg pain from mononeuritis multiplex.,She also takes Lasix for lower extremity edema.,The patient reports that she generally initiates sleep on CPAP, but rips her mask off, tosses and turns throughout the night and has """"terrible quality sleep."""",MEDICATIONS: , Current medications are as previously noted.  Changes include reduction in prednisone from 9 to 6 mg by mouth every morning.  She continues to take Ativan 1 mg every six hours as needed.  She takes imipramine 425 mg at bedtime.,Her MS Contin dose is 150 mg every 8 to 12 hours and an immediate release morphine preparation, 45 to 75 mg by mouth every 8 hours as needed.,FINDINGS: , Vital signs:  Blood pressure 153/81, pulse 90, respiratory rate 20, weight 311.8 pounds (up 10 pounds from earlier this month), height 5 feet 6 inches, temperature 98.4 degrees, SaO2 is 88% on room air at rest.  Chest is clear.  Extremities show lower extremity pretibial edema with erythema.,LABORATORIES: , An arterial blood gas on room air showed a pH of 7.38, PCO2 of 52, and PO2 of 57.,CPAP compliance monitoring over the past two to three weeks showed average use of 3 hours 26 minutes on nights used.  She used it for greater than 4 hours per night on 67% of night surveyed.  Her estimated apnea/hypopnea index was 3 per hour.  Her average leak flow was 67 liters per minute.,The patient's overnight sleep study was performed as an inpatient sleep study during a routine hospitalization for intravenous gamma globulin therapy.  She slept for a total sleep time of 257 minutes out of 272 minutes in bed (sleep efficiency approximately 90%).  Sleep stage distribution was relatively normal with 2% stage I, 72% stage II, 24% stage III, IV, and 2% stage REM sleep.,There were no periodic limb movements during sleep.,There was evidence of a severe predominantly central sleep apnea during non-REM sleep at 173 episodes per hour and during REM sleep at 77 episodes per hour.  Oxyhemoglobin saturations during non-REM sleep fluctuated from the baseline of 92% to an average low of 82%.  During REM sleep, the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation was 87% , decreased to 81% with sleep-disordered breathing episodes.,Of note, the sleep study was performed on CPAP at 10.5 cm of H2O with oxygen at 8 liters per minute.,ASSESSMENT:,1.  Obesity hypoventilation syndrome.  The patient has evidence of a well-compensated respiratory acidosis, which is probably primarily related to severe obesity.  In addition, there may be contribution from large doses of opiates and standing doses of gabapentin.,2.  Severe central sleep apnea, on CPAP at 10 cmH2O and supplemental oxygen at 8 liters per minute.  The breathing pattern is that of cluster or Biot's breathing throughout sleep.  The primary etiology is probably opiate use, with contribution with further exacerbation by severe obesity which acts to lower the baseline oxyhemoglobin saturation, and worsen desaturations during apneic episodes.,3.  Mononeuritis multiplex with pain requiring significant substantial doses of analgesia.,4.  Hypoxemia primarily due to obesity, hypoventilation, and presumably basilar atelectasis and a combination of V/Q mismatch and shunt on that basis.,PLANS: , My overall impression is that we should treat this patient's sleep disruption with measures to decrease central sleep apnea during sleep.  These will include, (1).  Decrease in evening doses of MS Contin, (2).  Modest weight loss of approximately 10 to 20 pounds, and (3).  Instituting Automated Servo Ventilation via nasal mask.  With regard to latter, the patient will be returning for a trial of ASV to examine its effect on sleep-disordered breathing patterns.,In addition, the patient will benefit from modest diuresis, with improvement of oxygenation, as well as nocturnal desaturation and oxygen requirements.  I have encouraged the patient to increase her dose of Lasix from 100 to 120 mg by mouth every morning as previously prescribed.

She has noticed it since she has been on Lipitor.  She has had some night sweats occasionally.  She has had a little bit of fever and nausea.  She has noticed her blood sugars have been low.  She has lost over 30 pounds after exercising doing water aerobics at Genesis in Wichita.  She has noticed her fasting blood sugars have been ranging from 100 to 120.  Blood sugars one and a half hours after meals have been 185.  She is coming in for a diabetic checkup in one month and wants lab prior to that time.

We will stop Lipitor, have her follow up in one month which she has already got planned for diabetes appointment and check symptoms at that time.  Certainly if her pain improves might consider something like Crestor, which is more water soluble, which may cause less adverse effects.  We will check her comprehensive metabolic panel to make sure the alkaline phosphatase is okay, may need an x-ray of back, hip, and legs at that time if symptoms are not gone.,2.  Hypercholesterolemia, this is somewhat bothersome as she is a diabetic.  Did discuss with her that we need to stick to the diet especially after going off of Lipitor.  We will see how she does with her bone pain/leg pain off of Lipitor.  If she has improvement may consider Crestor in one month.  I am going to check her lipid panel and a CMP.  Apparently, she is going to get this at a different site, Mapleridge in Wichita.,3.  Type II diabetes.  We will decrease her Glucovance because she is having frequent low blood sugars.  Her previous hemoglobin A1c was 5.6 so we will see if this improves her symptoms.

419,419,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and possible metabolic syndrome.  The patient reports that she has worked hard for a number of weeks following the meal plan prescribed, but felt like she was gaining weight and not losing weight on it.  She is not sure that she was following it accurately.  She is trying to walk 1-1/2 to 2 miles every other day, but is increasing her time in the garden and doing other yard work as well.  Once she started experiencing some weight gain, she went back to her old South Beach Diet and felt like she was able to take some of that weight off.  However she realizes that the South Beach Diet is not a healthy diet for her and so is coming back for better instruction on safe weight loss and low-fat eating.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 275 pounds.  Food records were reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient experienced a weight gain of 2 pounds since our last consultation which was two months ago.  I did carefully review her food records and evaluated calories consumed.  While she was carefully tracking the volume of protein and carbohydrates, she was getting some excess calories from the fatty proteins selected.  Thus we rearranged her meal plan a little bit and talked about how to track her fat calories as well.  She was more open to reducing the amount of protein from the previous meal plan and increasing slightly the amount of carbohydrates.  While this still is not as much carbohydrate as I would normally recommend, I am certainly willing to work with her on how she feels her body best handles weight reduction.  We also discussed a snack that could be eliminated in the morning because she really is not hungry at that time.,PLAN:,  A new 1500 calorie meal plan was developed based on 35% of the calories coming from protein, 40% of the calories from carbohydrate, and 25% of the calories from fat.  This translates in to 10 servings at 15 grams a piece of carbohydrates throughout the day dividing them in to groups of two servings per meal and per snack.  This also translates in to 2 ounces of protein at breakfast, 6 ounces at lunch, 2 ounces in the afternoon snack, 6 ounces at supper, and 2 ounces in the evening snack.  We have eliminated the morning snack.  The patient will now track the grams of fat in her meats as well as added fats.  Her goal for total fats over the course of the day is no more than 42 grams of fat per day.  This was a half hour consultation.  We will plan to see the patient back in one month for support.",subjective followup dietary consultation for hyperlipidemia hypertension possible metabolic syndrome patient report that work hard for number of week follow meal plan prescribe felt like gain weight lose weight on sure that follow accurately try walk mile every day increase time in garden yard work well once start experience weight gain go back old south beach diet felt like able take of weight however realize that south beach diet healthy diet for come back for good instruction on safe weight loss low fat eat objective weight pound food record review assessment patient experience weight gain of pound since last consultation two month ago carefully review food record evaluated calorie consume while carefully track volume of protein carbohydrates get excess calorie from fatty protein select thus rearrange meal plan little bit talk about track fat calorie as well open reduce amount of protein from previous meal plan increase slightly amount of carbohydrate while still much carbohydrate as would normally recommend certainly willing work with on feel body best handle weight reduction also discuss snack could eliminate in morning because really hungry at time plan new calorie meal plan develop base on of calorie come from protein of calorie from carbohydrate of calorie from fat translate in serving at gram piece of carbohydrate throughout day divide in group of two serving per meal per snack also translate in ounce of protein at breakfast ounce at lunch ounce in afternoon snack ounce at supper ounce in evening snack eliminate morning snack patient track gram of fat in meat well as added fat goal for total fat over course of day than gram of fat per day half hour consultation plan see patient back in one month for support
423,423,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 28-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for diabetes during pregnancy.  Patient reports that she had gestational diabetes with her first pregnancy.  She did use insulin at that time as well.  She does not fully understand what ketones are.  She walks her daughter to school and back home each day which takes 20 minutes each way.  She is not a big milk drinker, but she does try to drink some.,OBJECTIVE:,  Weight is 238.3 pounds.  Weight from last weeks visit was 238.9 pounds.  Prepregnancy weight is reported at 235 pounds.  Height is 62-3/4 inches.  Prepregnancy BMI is approximately 42-1/2.  Insulin schedule is NovoLog 70/30, 20 units in the morning and 13 units at supper time.  Blood sugar records for the last week reveal the following:  Fasting blood sugars ranging from 92 to 104 with an average of 97, two-hour postprandial breakfast readings ranging from 172 to 196 with an average of 181, two-hour postprandial lunch readings ranging from 149 to 189 with an average of 168 and two-hour postprandial dinner readings ranging from 109 to 121 with an average of 116.  Overall average is 140.  A diet history was obtained.  Expected date of confinement is May 1, 2005.  Instructed the patient on dietary guidelines for gestational diabetes.  A 2300 meal plan was provided and reviewed.  The Lily Guide for Meal Planning was provided and reviewed.,ASSESSMENT:,  Patients basal energy expenditure adjusted for obesity is estimated at 1566 calories a day.  Her total calorie requirements, including physical activity factors as well as additional calories for pregnancy, totals 2367 calories a day.  Her diet history reveals that she is eating three meals a day and three snacks.  The snacks were just added last week following presence of ketones in her urine.  We identified carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing that they are the foods that raise blood sugar the most.  We identified 15 gram equivalents of carbohydrate and established a carbohydrate budget.  We also discussed the goal of balancing food intake with blood sugar control and adequate caloric intake to sustain appropriate weight gain for the pregnancy of 1/2 a pound a week through the duration of the pregnancy.  We discussed the physiology of ketone production from inadequate calories or inadequate insulin and elevated blood sugars.  While a sample meal plan was provided reflecting the patients carbohydrate budget I emphasized the need for her to eat according to her appetite, but to work at consistency in the volume of carbohydrates consumed at a given meal or a given snack from day to day.  Patient was assured that we can titrate the insulin to match whatever eating pattern is suitable for her as long as she can do it on a consistent basis.  At the same time she was encouraged to continue to eliminate the more concentrated forms of refined carbohydrates.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient work with the following meal plan with a carbohydrate budget representing approximately 45% of the calories from carbohydrate.  Breakfast:  Three carbohydrate servings.  Morning snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Lunch:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Afternoon snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Supper:  Four carbohydrate servings.  Bedtime snack:  One carbohydrate serving.  Encouraged patient to include some solid protein with each of her meals as well as with the bedtime snack.  Encouraged three servings of dairy products per day to meet nutritional needs for calcium during pregnancy.  Recommend patient include a fruit or a vegetable with most of her meals.  Also recommend including solid protein with each meal as well as with the bedtime snack.  Charlie Athene reviewed blood sugars at this consultation as well, and made the following insulin adjustment:  Morning 70/30, will increase from 20 units up to 24 units and evening 70/30, we will increase from 13 units up to 16 units.  Patient was encouraged to call in blood sugars at the end of the week if they are outside of the range of over 90 fasting and over 120 two-hour postprandial.

She had positive sensitivity to most areas of her feet, however, she had negative sensitivity to the medial and lateral aspect of the balls of her left foot.,During the education session, she set behavioral goals for self care.  First goal is to eat three meals a day and eat three snacks daily to improve her blood glucose levels.  Second goal is to eat a well balanced meal at 1200 calories in order to lose one-half pound of weight per week and improve her blood glucose control.  Third goal is to exercise by walking for 15 to 30 minutes a day, three to five days a week to increase her blood glucose control.  Her success in achieving these goals will be followed in three months by a letter from the diabetes education class.,RECOMMENDATIONS:,  Since she is doing so well with her diet changes, her blood sugars have been within normal limits and sometimes on the low side, especially considering the fact that she has low blood sugar unawareness.

She has heavy periods lasting 7 to 14 days with spotting in between her periods.  The patient's uterus is 12.2 x 6.2 x 5.3 cm.  Her endometrial thickness is 2 cm.  Her adnexa is within normal limits.  The patient and I had a long discussion.  Consent was reviewed in layman's terms.  The patient understood the foreseeable risks and complications, the alternative treatments and procedure itself and recovery.  Questions were answered.  The patient was taken back to the operative suite.  The patient underwent pelvic examination and then carefully placed in dorsal lithotomy position.  The patient had excellent femoral pulses and there was no excessive extension or hyperflexion of the lower extremities.  The patient's history is that she is at risk for development of condyloma.  The patient's husband was found to have a laryngeal papillomatosis.  She has had a laparotomy, which is an infraumbilical incision appendectomy, a laparoscopy, and bilateral tubal ligation.  Her uterus appears to be mobile by 12-week size.  There is a good descend.  There appears to be no adnexal abnormalities.  Uterus is 12-week sized and has fibroids, it is boggy and probably has a component of adenomyosis.  The patient's cervix was dilated without difficulty utilizing Circon ACMI hysteroscope with a 12-degree lens.  The patient underwent hysteroscopy.  The outflow valve was opened at all times.  The inflow valve was opened just to achieve appropriate distension.  The patient did have no evidence of trauma of the cervix.  No Trendelenburg as we were in room #9.  The patient also had the bag held two fingerbreadths above the level of the heart.  The patient was seen.  There is a 2 x 3 cm focal thickening of the posterior wall of the uterus' endometrial lining, a more of a polypoid nature.  The patient also has one in the fundal area.  The thickened tissue was removed via sharp curettage.  Therefore, we reinserted the hysteroscope.  It appeared that there was an appropriate curettage and that all areas of suspicion were indeed removed.  The patient's procedure was ended with specimen being obtained and sent to Department of Pathology.

441,441,"CHIEF COMPLAINT:  ,Hip pain.,HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS:  ,The patient is a very pleasant 41-year-old white female that is known to me previously from our work at the Pain Management Clinic, as well as from my residency training program, San Francisco. We have worked collaboratively for many years at the Pain Management Clinic and with her departure there, she has asked to establish with me for clinic pain management at my office.  She reports moderate to severe pain related to a complicated past medical history.  In essence, she was seen at a very young age at the clinic for bilateral knee and hip pain and diagnosed with bursitis at age 23.  She was given nonsteroidals at that time, which did help with this discomfort.  With time, however, this became inadequate and she was seen later in San Francisco in her mid 30s by Dr. V, an orthopedist who diagnosed retroverted hips at Hospital.  She was referred for rehabilitation and strengthening.  Most of this was focused on her SI joints.  At that time, although she had complained of foot discomfort, she was not treated for it.  This was in 1993 after which she and her new husband moved to the Boston area, where she lived from 1995-1996.  She was seen at the Pain Center by Dr. R with similar complaints of hip and knee pain.  She was seen by rheumatologists there and diagnosed with osteoarthritis as well as osteophytosis of the back.  Medications at that time were salicylate and Ultram.,When she returned to Portland in 1996, she was then working for Dr. B.  She was referred to a podiatrist by her local doctor who found several fractured sesamoid bones in her both feet, but this was later found not to be the case.  Subsequently, nuclear bone scans revealed osteoarthritis.  Orthotics were provided.  She was given Paxil and Tramadol and subsequently developed an unfortunate side effect of grand mal seizure.  During this workup of her seizure, imaging studies revealed a pericardial fluid-filled cyst adhered to her ventricle.  She has been advised not to undergo any corrective or reparative surgery as well as to limit her activities since.  She currently does not have an established cardiologist having just changed insurance plans.  She is establishing care with Dr. S, of Rheumatology for her ongoing care.  Up until today, her pain medications were being written by Dr. Y prior to establishing with Dr. L.,Pain management in town had been first provided by the office of Dr. F. Under his care, followup MRIs were done which showed ongoing degenerative disc disease, joint disease, and facet arthropathy in addition to previously described sacroiliitis.  A number of medications were attempted there, including fentanyl patches with Flonase from 25 mcg titrated upwards to 50 mcg, but this caused oversedation.  She then transferred her care to Ab Cd, FNP under the direction of Dr. K.  Her care there was satisfactory, but because of her work schedule, the patient found this burdensome as well as the guidelines set forth in terms of monthly meetings and routine urine screens.  Because of a previous commitment, she was unable to make one unscheduled request to their office in order to produce a random urine screen and was therefore discharged.,PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  ,1.

446,446,"REASON FOR VISIT:  ,Followup cervical spinal stenosis.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  ,Ms. ABC returns today for followup regarding her cervical spinal stenosis.  I have last seen her on 06/19/07.  Her symptoms of right greater than left upper extremity pain, weakness, paresthesias had been worsening after an incident on 06/04/07, when she thought she had exacerbated her conditions while lifting several objects.,I referred her to obtain a cervical spine MRI.,She returns today stating that she continues to have right upper extremity pain, paresthesias, weakness, which she believes radiates from her neck.  She had some physical therapy, which has been helping with the neck pain.  The right hand weakness continues.  She states she has a difficult time opening jars, and doors, and often drops items from her right greater than left upper extremity.  She states she have several occasions when she is sleeping at night, she has had sharp shooting radicular pain and weakness down her left upper extremity and she feels that these symptoms somewhat scare her.,She has been undergoing nonoperative management by Dr. X and feels this has been helping her neck pain, but not the upper extremity symptoms.,She denies any bowel and bladder dysfunction.  No lower back pain, no lower extremity pain, and no instability with ambulation.,REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:,  Negative for fevers, chills, chest pain, and shortness of breath.,FINDINGS:  ,On examination, Ms. ABC is a very pleasant well-developed, well-nourished female in no apparent distress.  Alert and oriented x3.  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Afebrile to touch.,She ambulates with a normal gait.,Motor strength is 4 plus out of 5 in the bilateral deltoids, biceps, triceps muscle groups, 4 out of 5 in the bilateral hand intrinsic muscle groups, grip strength 4 out of 5, 4 plus out of 5 bilateral wrist extension and wrist flexion.,Light touch sensation decreased in the right greater than left C6 distribution.

There is no significant instability seen on flexion-extension views.,Updated cervical spine MRI dated 06/21/07 is reviewed.,It demonstrates evidence of moderate stenosis at C4-5, C5-6.  These stenosis is in the bilateral neural foramina and there is also significant disk herniation noted at the C6-7 level.  Minimal degenerative disk disease is seen at the C6-7.  This stenosis is greater than C5-6 and the next level is more significantly involved at C4-5.,Effacement of the ventral and dorsal CSF space is seen at C4-5, C5-6.,ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: , Ms. ABC's history, physical examination, and radiographic findings are compatible with C4-5, C5-6 cervical spinal stenosis with associated right greater than left upper extremity radiculopathy including weakness.,I spent a significant amount of time today with the patient discussing the diagnosis, prognosis, natural history, nonoperative, and operative treatment options.,I laid out the options as continued nonoperative management with physical therapy, the same with the addition of cervical epidural steroid injections and surgical interventions.,The patient states she would like to avoid injections and is somewhat afraid of having these done.  I explained to her that they may help to improve her symptoms, although they may not help with the weakness.,She feels that she is failing maximum nonoperative management and would like to consider surgical intervention.,I described the procedure consisting of C4-5, C5-6 anterior cervical decompression and fusion to the patient in detail on a spine model.,I explained the rationale for doing so including the decompression of the spinal cord and improvement of her upper extremity weakness and pain.  She understands.,I discussed the risks, benefits, and alternative of the procedure including material risks of bleeding, infection, neurovascular injury, dural tear, singular or multiple muscle weakness, paralysis, hoarseness of voice, difficulty swallowing, pseudoarthrosis, adjacent segment disease, and the risk of this given the patient's relatively young age.  Of note, the patient does have a hoarse voice right now, given the fact that she feels she has allergies.,I also discussed the option of disk arthroplasty.  She understands.,She would like to proceed with the surgery, relatively soon.  She has her birthday coming up on 07/20/07 and would like to hold off, until after then.

453,453,"SUBJECTIVE:,  This is a 62-year-old female who comes for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type I diabetes.  The patient reports that she was hospitalized over the weekend for DKA.  She indicates that her blood sugar on Friday night was 187 at bedtime and that when she woke up in the morning her blood sugar was 477.  She gave herself, in smaller increments, a total of 70 extra units of her Humalog.  Ten of those units were injectable; the others were in the forms of pump.  Her blood sugar was over 600 when she went to the hospital later that day.  She is here at this consultation complaining of not feeling well still because she has a cold.  She realizes that this is likely because her immune system was so minimized in the hospital.,OBJECTIVE:,  Current insulin doses on her insulin pump are boluses set at 5 units at breakfast, 6 units at lunch and 11 units at supper.  Her basal rates have not been changed since her last visit with Charla Yassine and totaled 30.5 units per 24 hours.  A diet history was obtained.  I instructed the patient on carbohydrate counting at 1 unit of insulin for every 10 g carbohydrate ratio was recommended.  A correction dose of approximately 1 unit of insulin to bring the blood sugars down 30 mg/dl was also recommended.  The Lilly guide for meal planning was provided and reviewed.  Additional carbohydrate counting book was provided.,ASSESSMENT:,  The patient was taught an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio of 1 unit to 10 g of carbohydrates as recommended at the previous visit two years ago, which she does not recall.  It is based on the 500 rule which suggests this ratio.  We did identify carbohydrate sources in the food supply, recognizing 15-g equivalents.  We also identified the need to dose her insulin at the time that she is eating her carbohydrate sources.  She does seem to have a pattern of fixing blood sugars later in the day after they are elevated.  We discussed the other option of trying to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrates at meals from day to day and taking a consistent amount of insulin at those meals.  With this in mind, she was recommended to follow with three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at breakfast, three servings or 45 g of carbohydrate at lunch and four servings or 60 g of carbohydrate at dinner.  Joanne Araiza joined our consultation briefly to discuss whether her pump was working appropriately.  The patient was given an 800 number for the pump to contact should there be any question about its failure to deliver insulin appropriately.,PLAN:,  Recommend the patient use 1 unit of insulin for every 10-g carbohydrate load consumed.  Recommend the patient either use this as a carbohydrate counting tool or work harder at keeping carbohydrate content consistent at meals from day to day.  This was a one-hour consultation.  Provided my name and number should additional needs arise.",subjective year old female come for dietary consultation for carbohydrate counting for type diabetes patient report that hospitalize over weekend for dka indicate that blood sugar on friday night at bedtime that wake in morning blood sugar give in small increment total of extra unit of humalog ten of unit others in form of pump blood sugar go hospital later day at consultation complaining of feel well still because cold realize that likely because immune system minimize in hospital objective current insulin dos on insulin pump boluses set at unit at breakfast unit at lunch unit at supper basal rate change since last visit with charla yassine total unit per hour diet history obtain instruct patient on carbohydrate counting at unit of insulin for every g carbohydrate ratio recommend correction dose of approximately unit of insulin bring blood sugar also recommend lilly guide for meal planning provide review additional carbohydrate counting book provide assessment patient teach insulin carbohydrate ratio of unit g of carbohydrate as recommend at previous visit two year ago recall base on rule suggest ratio identify carbohydrate source in food supply recognize g equivalent also identify need dose insulin at time that eat carbohydrate source seem pattern of fix blood sugar later in day after elevate discuss option of try eat consistent amount of carbohydrate at meal from day day take consistent amount of insulin at meal with in mind recommend follow with three serving g of carbohydrate at breakfast three serving g of carbohydrate at lunch four serving g of carbohydrate at dinner joanne araiza join consultation briefly discuss whether pump work appropriately patient give number for pump contact question about failure deliver insulin appropriately plan recommend patient use unit of insulin for every g carbohydrate load consume recommend patient either use as carbohydrate count tool work harder at keep carbohydrate content consistent at meal from day day one hour consultation provide name number additional need arise

467,467,"The patient made some progress during therapy.  She accomplished two and a half out of her five short-term therapy goals.  We did complete an oral mechanism examination and clinical swallow evaluation, which showed her swallowing to be within functional limits.  The patient improved on her turn taking skills during conversation, and she was able to listen to a narrative and recall the main idea plus five details after a three-minute delay independently.  The patient continues to have difficulty with visual scanning in cancellation task, secondary to her significant left neglect.  She also did not accomplish her sustained attention goal, which required her to complete tasks greater than 80% accuracy for at least 15 minutes independently.

478,478,"HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: ,  The patient is a 48-year-old man who has had abdominal pain since October of last year associated with a 30-pound weight loss and then developed jaundice.  He had epigastric pain and was admitted to the hospital.  A thin-slice CT scan was performed, which revealed a 4 x 3 x 2 cm pancreatic mass with involved lymph nodes and ring enhancing lesions consistent with liver metastases.  The patient, additionally, had a questionable pseudocyst in the tail of the pancreas.  The patient underwent ERCP on 04/04/2007 with placement of a stent.  This revealed a strictured pancreatic duct, as well as strictured bile duct.  A 10-french x 9 cm stent was placed with good drainage.  The next morning, the patient felt quite a bit more comfortable.  He additionally had a modest drop in his bilirubin and other liver tests.  Of note, the patient has been having quite a bit of nausea during his admission.  This responded to Zofran.  It did not, initially, respond well to Phenergan, though after stent placement, he was significantly more comfortable and had less nausea, and in fact, had better response to the Phenergan itself.  At the time of discharge, the patient's white count was 9.4, hemoglobin 10.8, hematocrit 32 with a MCV of 79, platelet count of 585,000.  His sodium was 132, potassium 4.1, chloride 95, CO2 27, BUN of 8 with a creatinine of 0.3.  His bilirubin was 17.1, alk phos 273, AST 104, ALT 136, total protein 7.8 and albumin of 3.8.  He was tolerating a regular diet.  The patient had been on oral hypoglycemics as an outpatient, but in hospital, he was simply managed with an insulin sliding scale.  The patient will be transferred back to Pelican Bay, under the care of Dr. X at the infirmary.  He will be further managed for his diabetes there.  The patient will additionally undergo potential end of life meetings.  I discussed the potentials of chemotherapy with patient.  Certainly, there are modest benefits, which can be obtained with chemotherapy in metastatic pancreatic cancer, though at some cost with morbidity.  The patient will consider this and will discuss this further with Dr. X.  ,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.  Phenergan 25 mg q.6. p.r.n.,2.  Duragesic patch 100 mcg q.3.d.,3.  Benadryl 25-50 mg p.o. q.i.d. for pruritus.,4.  Sliding scale will be discontinued at the time of discharge and will be reinstituted on arrival at Pelican Bay Infirmary.,5.

He stated that he never had blood in his urine before, however, he does have a past history of BPH and he had a transurethral resection of prostate more than 10 years ago. He was admitted to a regular bed. Dr. G of Urology was consulted for evaluation of his hematuria. During the workup for this, he had a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast with early and late-phase imaging for evaluation of the kidneys and collecting system. At that time, he was shown to have multiple bilateral renal cysts with one that did not meet classification as a simple cyst and ultrasound was recommended.,He had an ultrasound done of the cyst which showed a 2.1 x 2.7 cm mass arising from the right kidney which, again, did not fit ultrasound criteria for a simple cyst and they recommended further evaluation by an MRI as this could be a hemorrhagic cyst or a solid mass or tumor, so an MRI was scheduled on the day of discharge for further evaluation of this. The report was not back at discharge. The patient had a cystoscopy and transurethral resection of prostate as well with entire resection of the prostate gland. Pathology on this specimen showed multiple portions of prostatic tissue which was primarily fibromuscular, and he was diagnosed with nonprostatic hyperplasia. His urine slowly cleared. He tolerated a regular diet with no difficulties in his activities of daily living, and his Foley was removed on the day of discharge.,He was started on ciprofloxacin, Colace, and Lasix after the transurethral resection and continued these for a short course.

He has undergone MRI of the abdomen on June 18, 2008 revealing an enhancing mass of the upper pole of the left kidney consistent with his history of renal cell carcinoma.  Of note, there are no other enhancing solid masses seen on this MRI.  After discussion of multiple management strategies with the patient including:,1.  Left partial nephrectomy.,2.  Left radical nephrectomy.,3.  Left renal cyst decortication.  The patient is likely to undergo the latter procedure.,HOSPITAL COURSE:  ,The patient was admitted to undergo left renal cyst decortication as well as a cystoscopy.  Intraoperatively, approximately four enlarged renal cysts and six smaller renal cysts were initially removed.  The contents were aspirated and careful dissection of the cyst wall was performed.  Multiple specimens of the cyst wall were sent for pathology.  Approximately one liter of cystic fluid was drained during the procedure.  The renal bed was inspected for hemostasis, which appear to be adequate.  There were no complications with the procedure.  Single JP drain was left in place.  Additionally, the patient underwent flexible cystoscopy, which revealed no gross strictures or any other abnormalities in the penile nor prostatic urethra.  Furthermore, no gross lesions were encountered in the bladder.  The patient left OR with transfer to the PACU and subsequently to the hospital floor.,The patient's postoperative course was relatively uneventful.  His diet and activity were gradually advanced without complication.  On postoperative day #2, he was passing flatus and has had bowel movements.  His Jackson-Pratt drain was discontinued on postoperative day #3 that being the day of discharge.  His Foley catheter was removed on the morning of discharge and the patient subsequently passed the voiding trial without difficultly.  At the time of discharge, he was afebrile.

527,527,"ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS: , Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:,  Trauma/ATV accident resulting in left open humerus fracture.,SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:,  None.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , For complete details, please see dictated history and physical by Dr. X dated July 23, 2008.  Briefly, the patient is a 10-year-old male who presented to the Hospital Emergency Department following an ATV accident.  He was an unhelmeted passenger on ATV when the driver lost control and the ATV rolled over throwing the passenger and the driver approximately 5 to 10 meters.  The patient denies any loss of consciousness.  He was not amnestic to the event.  He was taken by family members to the Iredell County Hospital, where he was initially evaluated.  Due to the extent of his injuries, he was immediately transferred to Hospital Emergency Department for further evaluation.,HOSPITAL COURSE: , Upon arrival in the Hospital Emergency Department, he was noted to have an open left humerus fracture.  No other apparent injuries.  This was confirmed with radiographic imaging showing that the chest and pelvis x-rays were negative for any acute injury and that the cervical spine x-ray was negative for fracture malalignment.  The left upper extremity x-ray did demonstrate an open left distal humerus fracture.  The orthopedic surgery team was then consulted and upon their evaluation, the patient was taken emergently to the operating room for surgical repair of his left humerus fracture.  In the operating room, the patient was prepared for an irrigation and debridement of what was determined to be an open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture.  In the operating room, his upper extremity was evaluated for neurovascular status and great care was taken to preserve these structures.  Throughout the duration of the procedure, the patient had a palpable distal radial pulse.  The orthopedic team then completed an open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture.  A wound VAC was then placed over the wound at the conclusion of the procedure.  The patient tolerated this procedure well and was returned to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for postsurgical followup and monitoring.  His diet was advanced and his pain was controlled with pain medication.  The day following his surgery, the patient was evaluated for a potential for closed head injury given the nature of his accident and the fact that he was not wearing a helmet during his accident.  A CT of the brain without contrast showed no acute intracranial abnormalities moreover his cervical spine was radiographically and clinically cleared and his C-collar was removed at that point.  Once his C spine had been cleared and the absence of a closed head injury was confirmed.  The patient was then transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to the General Floor bed.  His clinical status continued to improve and on July 26, 2008, he was taken back to the operating room for removal of the wound VAC and closure of his left upper extremity wound.  He again tolerated this procedure well on his return to the General Pediatrics Floor.  Throughout his stay, there was concern for compartment syndrome due to the nature and extent of his injuries.  However, frequent checks of his distal pulses indicated that he had strong peripheral pulses in the left upper extremity.  Moreover, the patient had no complaints of paresthesia.  There was no demonstration of pallor or pain on passive motion.  There was good capillary refill to the digits of the left hand.  By the date of the discharge, the patient was on a full pediatric select diet and was tolerating this well.  He had no abdominal tenderness and there were no abdominal injuries on exam or radiographic studies.  He was afebrile and his vital signs were stable and once cleared by Orthopedics, he was deemed appropriate for discharge.,PROCEDURES DURING THIS HOSPITALIZATION:,1.  Irrigation and debridement of open type 3 subcondylar left distal humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,2.  Open reduction and internal fixation of the left supracondylar humerus fracture (July 23, 2008).,3.  Negative pressure wound dressing (July 23, 2008).,4.

He was asked to followup with return appointment in one week to see Dr. Y in Orthopedics.  Additionally, he was told to call his pediatrician, if he develops any fevers, pain, loss of sensation, loss of pulse, or discoloration of his fingers, or paleness to his hand.",admit diagnosis accident result in left open humerus fracture discharge diagnosis accident result in left open humerus fracture secondary diagnosis none history of present illness for complete detail please see dictated history physical by dr x date july briefly patient year old male present hospital emergency department follow atv accident unhelmeted passenger on atv driver lose control atv roll throw passenger driver approximately meter patient deny loss of consciousness amnestic event take by family member iredell county hospital initially evaluate due extent of injury immediately transfer hospital emergency department for evaluation hospital course upon arrival in hospital emergency department note open left humerus fracture apparent injury confirm with radiographic image show that chest pelvis x ray negative for acute injury that cervical spine x ray negative for fracture malalignment left upper extremity x ray demonstrate open left distal humerus fracture orthopedic surgery team consult upon evaluation patient take emergently operating room for surgical repair of left humerus fracture in operating room patient prepare for irrigation debridement of determine open type subcondylar leave distal humerus fracture in operating room upper extremity evaluate for neurovascular status great care take preserve structure throughout duration of procedure patient palpable distal radial pulse orthopedic team complete open reduction internal fixation of left supracondylar humerus fracture wound vac place over wound at conclusion of procedure patient tolerate procedure well return pediatric intensive care unit for postsurgical followup monitor diet advance pain control with pain medication day follow surgery patient evaluate for potential for closed head injury give nature of accident fact that wear helmet during accident ct of brain without contrast show acute intracranial abnormality moreover cervical spine radiographically clinically clear c collar remove at point c spine clear absence of closed head injury confirm patient transfer from intensive care unit general floor bed clinical status continue improve on july take back operating room for removal of wound vac closure of left upper extremity wound tolerate procedure well on return general pediatrics floor throughout stay concern for compartment syndrome due nature extent of injury however frequent check of distal pulse indicate that strong peripheral pulse in left upper extremity moreover patient complaint of paresthesia demonstration of pallor pain on passive motion good capillary refill digit of left hand by date of discharge patient on full pediatric select diet tolerate well abdominal tenderness abdominal injury on exam radiographic study afebrile vital sign stable clear by orthopedics deem appropriate for discharge procedure during hospitalization irrigation debridement of open type subcondylar leave distal humerus fracture open reduction internal fixation of left supracondylar humerus fracture negative pressure wound dress irrigation debridement of left elbow fracture ct of brain without contrast disposition home with parent invasive line none discharge instruction patient instruct that return home with regular diet ask strenuous activity move furniture lift heavy object use left upper extremity ask followup with return appointment in one week see dr in orthopedics additionally tell call pediatrician if develop fever pain loss of sensation loss of pulse discoloration of finger paleness hand
531,531,"REASON FOR ADMISSION: , Fever of unknown origin.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , The patient is a 39-year-old woman with polymyositis/dermatomyositis on methotrexate once a week.  The patient has also been on high-dose prednisone for an urticarial rash.  The patient was admitted because of persistent high fevers without a clear-cut source of infection.  She had been having temperatures of up to 103 for 8-10 days.  She had been seen at Alta View Emergency Department a week prior to admission.  A workup there including chest x-ray, blood cultures, and a transthoracic echocardiogram had all remained nondiagnostic, and were normal.  Her chest x-ray on that occasion was normal.  After the patient was seen in the office on August 10, she persisted with high fevers and was admitted on August 11 to Cottonwood Hospital.  Studies done at Cottonwood:  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Results:  CT chest showed mild bibasilar pleural-based interstitial changes.  These were localized to mid and lower lung zones.  The process was not diffuse.  There was no ground glass change.  CT abdomen and pelvis was normal.  Infectious disease consultation was obtained.  Dr. XYZ saw the patient.  He ordered serologies for CMV including a CMV blood PCR.  Next serologies for EBV, Legionella, Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Coccidioides, and cryptococcal antigen, and a PPD.  The CMV serology came back positive for IgM.  The IgG was negative.  The CMV blood PCR was positive, as well.  Other serologies and her PPD stayed negative.  Blood cultures stayed negative.,In view of the positive CMV, PCR, and the changes in her CAT scan, the patient was taken for a bronchoscopy.  BAL and transbronchial biopsies were performed.  The transbronchial biopsies did not show any evidence of pneumocystis, fungal infection, AFB.  There was some nonspecific interstitial fibrosis, which was minimal.  I spoke with the pathologist, Dr. XYZ and immunopathology was done to look for CMV.  The patient had 3 nucleoli on the biopsy specimens that stained positive and were consistent with CMV infection.  The patient was started on ganciclovir once her CMV serologies had come back positive.  No other antibiotic therapy was prescribed.  Next, the patient's methotrexate was held.,A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed some bibasilar disease, showing interstitial infiltrates.  The patient was given ibuprofen and acetaminophen during her hospitalization, and her fever resolved with these measures.,On the BAL fluid cell count, the patient only had 5 WBCs and 5 RBCs on the differential.  It showed 43% neutrophils, 45% lymphocytes.,Discussions were held with Dr. XYZ, Dr. XYZ, her rheumatologist, and with pathology.,DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:,1.  Disseminated CMV infection with possible CMV pneumonitis.,2.  Polymyositis on immunosuppressive therapy (methotrexate and prednisone).,DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:,1.

History of urinary tract infections of pyelonephritis.,OPERATIONS PERFORMED: , Chest x-ray July 24, 2007, that was normal.  Transesophageal echocardiogram July 27, 2007, that was normal.  No evidence of vegetations.  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis July 27, 2007, that revealed multiple small cysts in the liver, the largest measuring 9 mm.  There were 2-3 additional tiny cysts in the right lobe.  The remainder of the CT scan was normal.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , Briefly, the patient is a 26-year-old white female with a history of fevers.  For further details of the admission, please see the previously dictated history and physical.  ,HOSPITAL COURSE:,  Gram-negative rod bacteremia.  The patient was admitted to the hospital with suspicion of endocarditis given the fact that she had fever, septicemia, and Osler nodes on her fingers.  The patient had a transthoracic echocardiogram as an outpatient, which was equivocal, but a transesophageal echocardiogram here in the hospital was normal with no evidence of vegetations.  The microbiology laboratory stated that the Gram-negative rod appeared to be anaerobic, thus raising the possibility of organisms like bacteroides.  The patient does have a history of congenital genitourinary abnormalities which were surgically corrected before the fifth grade.  We did a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which only showed some benign appearing cysts in the liver.  There was nothing remarkable as far as her kidneys, ureters, or bladder were concerned.  I spoke with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases, and Dr. XYZ asked me to talk to the patient about any contact with animals, given the fact that we have had a recent outbreak of tularemia here in Utah.  Much to my surprise, the patient told me that she had multiple pet rats at home, which she was constantly in contact with.  I ordered tularemia and leptospirosis serologies on the advice of Dr. XYZ, and as of the day after discharge, the results of the microbiology still are not back yet.  The patient, however, appeared to be responding well to levofloxacin.  I gave her a 2-week course of 750 mg a day of levofloxacin, and I have instructed her to follow up with Dr. XYZ in the meantime.  Hopefully by then we will have a final identification and susceptibility on the organism and the tularemia and leptospirosis serologies will return.  A thought of ours was to add doxycycline, but again the patient clinically appeared to be responding to the levofloxacin.  In addition, I told the patient that it would be my recommendation to get rid of the rats.  I told her that if indeed the rats were carriers of infection and she received a zoonotic infection from exposure to the rats, that she could be in ongoing continuing danger and her children could also potentially be exposed to a potentially lethal infection.  I told her very clearly that she should, indeed, get rid of the animals.  The patient seemed reluctant to do so at first, but I believe with some coercion from her family, that she finally came to the realization that this was a recommendation worth following.,  ,DISPOSITION,DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: , Activity is as tolerated.  Diet is as tolerated.,MEDICATIONS: , Levaquin 750 mg daily x14 days.,Followup is with Dr. XYZ of infectious diseases.  I gave the patient the phone number to call on Monday for an appointment.
